# Take Two: The 5 Acts of Conness


## Introduction
Mt. Conness has been stuck in my mind like bubble gum gets stuck to the bottom of your shoe. You want to forget about it but it bothers you at every step. Three years ago, after backpacking all my gear to Young Lakes, getting up at 4:30am for the approach, hiking several hours to the base of the climb, putting on my climbing shoes, racking up, roping up, oh, and then throwing up several times (I believe my stomach had an bad reaction to the sugar contained in electrolyte drinks I'd consumed on the approach), I made a very tough call at the base to back off the climb. My partner was amazingly understanding, I never knew if I'd made the right call and it has bothered me ever since. My idea of using the brake is to let off a bit on the gas, so this was a bit out of character for me, but I didn't want to take a chance on slowing up my partner and the others two groups if I continued to be sick on the climb. For various reasons, we didn't make it back to Conness the next two summers but this time it was going to be different, I owed my partner a route and the mountain some retribution. We marked the weekend on the calendar early on, got our permits, planned, and trained.
Take two almost didn't happen - two weeks before our summit date I hiked Half Dome and a week before I hiked Cathedral. On the way back from Cathedral I seriously hyper-extended my knee several times using crutches afterwards. By the time we were supposed to leave for Conness I was hobbling around and just like three years ago, I had to cancel (albeit from the bay area this time vs the base of the climb). Fortunately, the knee healed enough that by the following weekend I thought I'd be able to give it a go.
We had climbed a few of the longer classic moderate routes in Yosemite including Mt Tenaya, Cathedral Peak, and Royal Arches. I'd watched my friends who continued on to climb Conness three years ago roll back into camp at 7pm and 11:30pm respectively. So given my prior limited experience, and from talking to my friends, I had an idea what the climb entailed. Conness is so dramatically different then the other moderate Yosemite routes though - for those are all single act plays - one day wonders (unless you really screw up). Conness is 5 strenuous acts back to back. Due to both the backpacking and approach/descent, Conness is to climbing what a triathlon is to running. In other words, it's not just the running portion, it's also the pre/post activities that come into play. Looking back though, knowing all that, I still really underestimated it. It was longer, harder, and more mentally taxing than I’d expected. A simple example is that it is twice the approach (really more), twice the descent, and twice the climb, plus around 10 hours of backpacking more than Cathedral Peak.



## Act 1
Act 1 is a beautiful yet grueling 8 mile hike with what for me was a 65 pound backpack (camping gear, food, rope, & climbing gear) from about 8K to 10K feet of elevation. The payoff is Upper Young Lake - one of the most picturesque high Sierra lakes out there. The backpack and camping trip by itself is a 5 star adventure with grand views of the Sierra divide and some of the great Yosemite granite monoliths and mountains.



## Act 2
Act 2 is a cross country approach that gains another 1000 feet plus another 500 or so down and up. You generally point yourself in a direction and begin hiking in the dark (we left at 5:15am this time around). It could have been / should have been much faster but we got off course and gained about 500 or more feet of extra altitude "just because." Don't make the same mistake!
Peter Croft is quoted in the guidebook saying that “Connes is perhaps the best moderate alpine climb in Tuolumne.” When I got to the 11,000 foot base of the climb after a 4:30 minute approach without any breakfast and without an appetite those grandiose thoughts were completely clouded by my exhaustion. Acts 1 and 2 were complete though, and now the fun would truly begin (ready or not).



## Act 3
Probably due to the lack of calories and exhaustion, act 3 began as a blur. There were two groups in front of us - so after they left we racked up, roped up, and started. It was 10:15am, climb on! The next day I could hardly recall those first three pitches - I’d essentially blanked them out. It wasn’t until I watched my climbing videos later from my GoPro that some of those pitches came back to me. I was certainly in a zone (dazed is the right word for it) that morning. I do remember at one point looking up for 15-30 seconds at the mini-roof above me thinking how can a 5.6 route have a roof, how can a 5.6 route have a roof, ... For whatever reason I ended up running out a lot of those first 3 pitches. I must say though, on reflection, they were really amazing pitches, stiff 5.6, unrelenting, with high quality granite, and crazy views.
The 4th pitch pulled me completely out of my morning haze as the climbing crux of the route transitioned into a series of mental cruxes. Essentially the first 3 pitches go up a nice arete on the climber’s left gaining altitude quickly but then top off on a little arete that plummets eagerly away on both sides and dead ends into a gnarly formation we called the witches fingernails that point thinly up into the air. At the knuckles of the formation the idea is to down climb/lead, and cross over a little granite bridge no wider then a sidewalk that drops one thousand feet plus on both sides. I really wasn’t mentally prepared, but I took a few deep breaths and locked in and made the moves. I thought that would be the end of it but there were two more similar sections, not quite as hard, but still more nervy then I was prepared for.
After that the climb cruises easily for quite some time and we were able to relax and enjoy climbing, the view, and what was nearly perfect weather. The only downside was that we were moving like snails, pitching everything out, with free soloists and simul climbers passing us. After a while I realized we were going to turn Act 4 into a legitimate part of the play.
The climbing near the top actually became harder for a pitch or two, with a little wall that is likely 5.6 and some other good solid sections. The cool thing about the middle pitches of Conness is that you are literally on a ridge and your right hand is often on a hold that's at the top of the vertical Conness wall. You can look over and look down a couple thousand feet. The entire climb has some great exposure (if you like that sort of thing).
A few hundred feet from the top the right hand ridge you’re climbing on (known as the West Ridge) joins a ridge that had previously been visible to our left. At this point the climb turns into class 3 scrambling. By then, it was around 6:30pm, so we de-roped and scrambled the rest of the way to the top peaking out at around 7:15pm. Finally making it to the top was great, it had been a long day, but what wasn't so great was that we were there after 7pm, around 45 minutes before dark, with several hours of descent to look forward to.
Thinking back on the climb, I’d describe it this way:
First 3 pitches are probably the climbing crux
Next 3 to 4 pitches are the mental crux
Next several pitches are easy, fun, fast, and very enjoyable
Last set of pitches are similar to the first 3, but at a higher altitude several hours later
The last section turns into a lot of scrambling up a larger scree/boulder pile



## Act 4
Act 4 is the art of getting from the 12,595’ summit back to your campsite several miles away at around 10K’. Darkness renders Act 4 more interesting. Unfortunately the hardest part of the return navigation is the very end when you are the most tired. We made some good decisions on the descent and made it back to our campsite at 10:15pm. Thus, peak to tent, act 4, took us a total of 3 hours.
So that left us at around 7.5 hours of hiking for the day (by comparison half dome was only a couple hours longer), 9 hours of climbing, 1600 feet or so of climbing, and 2.5K feet of net altitude gained, and a total of 17 hours “tent to tent”.
We crashed that night and the next morning enjoyed a perfectly smooth lake while I ate my Mountain Home dinner from the night before and my breakfast. Major refueling.



## Act 5
Act 5 was a slog, that’s all there is to it. It’s normally a straightforward downhill 8 mile hike but the backpack weight on top of the first 4 acts made it one of those climbing "grin and bear it" situations.



## Beta
- Camping: Definitely stay at Upper Young Lake. It's an awesome camping location.
- Time: If you think you're the type to pitch out a lot of the climb, get to the base as early as possible because finding your way back in the dark is actually pretty challenging and you really want to avoid it (unless you have a GPS system). The first time we did the approach we left around 4:30am and arrived at the base of the climb around 9am (but we stopped by Roosevelt Lake for water - a mistake). This time we left at 5:15am and arrived at 9:45 without going to Roosevelt and we were 3rd in line. It can be done in 2.5 hours if you nail the approach. If you are pitching it out, I recommend being at the base of the climb by 7:30am and climbing by 7:45 or 8am worst case.
- Approach: We’ve made the same mistake on the approach twice now - we go down the valley and back up the other side and both times we accidentally stayed too far to the right gaining too much altitude. Make sure and aim for the meadow - go straight at it. Once in the meadow, stay to the right (do not go to Roosevelt Lake - it’s way out of the way). Go up to the right gradually, aiming for the corner of Mount Conness where the wall hits a scree field. We found the start both times, but it's not that easy to find so do your upfront research (unless there are climbers already there). I highly recommend a GPS with some waypoints to both minimize the approach time and to give you confidence you've arrived at the legitimate start of the climb.
- Rack: I took a typical double rack smalls purple/blue through BD blue #3 without nuts. If I had it to do over again I’d probably triple the small cams, I found an abundance of small cracks and not that many #1/#2/#3 placements.
- Rope: We took a 9.1mm 60m, if you’re going to pitch it out I’d take a 70’ even though it’s extra hiking weight.
- Water: We took 4 liters (one bottle and a 3 liter camelbak) and drank the first liter on the approach and came home with water left.
- Simul: If we had it to do over again we’d likely begin simul climbing around pitch 5 and then maybe rope up for a pitch or two up high where there's some more legit climbing again.
- Food: I usually have no appetite issue at altitude but this time I did, what saved me was Gu. I often bring several packets but don’t use it - this time I think I had 5 Gu packages which was the majority of the calories that I consumed on the climb. The other thing that tasted great was mango slices from Trader Joes.
